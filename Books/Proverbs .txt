What goes around comes around
What goes around, comes around
What goes up must come down
What is learnt in the cradle lasts to the tombs
What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander
What the eye does not see the heart does not grieve over
What the eye does not see, the heart does not grieve over
What you lose on the swings you gain on the roundabouts
What you see is what you get
Whatever will be, will be
When in Rome, do as the Romans do St Ambrose 347AD
When in Rome, do as the Romans do
When it rains it pours
When it rains, it pours
When life gives you lemons, make lemonade
When one door closes another door opens
When the cat is away, the mice will play
When the cat's away the mice will play
When the going gets tough, the tough get going
When the oak is before the ash, then you will only get a splash; when the ash is before the oak, then you may expect a soak
When three women gather, it becomes noisy
When you have seen one, you have seen them all
Where there is a will there is a way
Where there is life there is hope
Where there is muck there is brass
Where there's a will, there's a way
Where there's smoke, there's fire
Whether you think you can, or you think you can't, you're right
While there is life there is hope
Who will bell the cat?
Whom the Gods love die young
Why keep a dog and bark yourself?
William Congreve, The Mourning Bride, Act III scene viii
With great responsibility comes great power
Woman is the root of both good and evil
Wonders will never cease
Work expands so as to fill the time available
Worrying never did anyone any good
You are never too old to learn
You are what you eat
You can have too much of a good thing
You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink
You can lead a horse to water, but you cannot make it drink
You can never/never can tell
You can't have your cake and eat it too
You can't please everyone
You can't take it with you
You can't teach an old dog new tricks
You can't win them all
You cannot always get what you want
You cannot eat your cake and have it too
You cannot get blood out of a stone
You cannot make a silk purse from a sow's ear
You cannot make an omelette without breaking eggs
You cannot make bricks without straw
You cannot run with the hare and hunt with the hounds
You cannot win them all
You catch more flies with honey than with vinegar
You get what you pay for
You have to break a few eggs to make an omlette
You have to take the good  with the bad
You may/might as well be hanged/hung for a sheep as for a lamb
You must have rocks in your head
You pay your money and you take your choice
You scratch my back and I will scratch yours
You win some, you lose some
You've got to separate the wheat from the chaff
You've made your bed and you must lie in/on it
Youth is wasted on the young
Zeal without knowledge is fire without light
